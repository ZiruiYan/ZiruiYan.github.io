== About me
I am Ph.D. student in [https://www.ecse.rpi.edu Electrical, Computer, and System Engineering Department] at [http://https://www.rpi.edu Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI)], working under the supervision of [https://www.ecse.rpi.edu/~tajer Prof. Ali Tajer]. Before that, I graduated from University of Science and Technology of China.\n

== Research
My current research topic is *causal bandit* (see [https://github.com/ZiruiYan/awesome-causal-bandit github repo] for brief summary) and the *causality in Large Language models (LLM)*. I also have broad interests in the application of bandit in *federated learning*.
